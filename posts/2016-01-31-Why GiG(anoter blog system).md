`github-pages` is a great place for blog hosting. Stable, no limit of size and totally free. The only 不满意之处 of me is I can not edit and preview my blog on my blog comfortably. Usually when I want to write or edit a blog, I have to open an editor on my laptop. The editor on github website is ok for laptop, but not for phone. So I think maybe there is a mark for [GiG](github.com/timqian/GiG) -- a blog system using github repo as its backend, and user can edit, preview his post easier.
