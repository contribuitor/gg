`gh-pages` is a good place for blog hosting. Stable, with no limit of site size and most importantly, it's totally free. The only 不满意之处 of me is I can not edit and preview my blog or note on the site comfotably. Every time I want to write a post, I have to open up my laptop. Your can add post on your github repo, yes, and editor of github is good if you are using laptop. But not on my phone. It is just  not so convient to write post to gh-pages. So I made this!
